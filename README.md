# JavaFX Drawing Pane
This project is a JavaFX application created during my Computer Science studies.

The application provides a simple drawing pane where the user can place colored dots freely. There are no restrictions on the number of points or their positions — users can draw as many points as they want, wherever they want. The result does not have to form a specific image; the focus is on free and experimental drawing.

The purpose of this project was to practice working with JavaFX, event handling, and graphical user interfaces. It serves as an educational project demonstrating basic drawing and user interaction concepts in JavaFX.
